Quote of the Day system
This system is made up of three parts:
1. qotd-website
The website that displays a quote

2. qotd-backend
Backend service that serves up quotes

3. postgres database service
Database containing quotes

After installation (helm install...) you'll need to set one or two environment variables.

1. REQUIRED: environment variable ##QOTD_API_URL## in deployment "qotd-website"
The value must be the URL of the qotd-backend service, appended with "/quotes/random"

For example: 

oc set env deploy/qotd-website QOTD_API_URL=https://qotd-backend-userid-dev.apps.sandbox-m3.1530.p1.openshiftapps.com/quotes/random

After this, the qotd-website will replace the existing pod and any quotes supplied are hard-coded into the qotd-backend service.

2. OPTIONAL: environment variable USE_DB in deployment "qotd-backend"
This value must be set to "true" for the backend to switch from using hard-coded quotes to reading from the database.

For example:

oc set env deploy/qotd-backend USE_DB=true
